# data_mining

As a Data Scientist one task I repeatedly have to conduct is data mining. Although the data base might differ from project to project there still are enough operations which are applicable on the majority of the data. Instead of writing the code for data mining over and over again, I wrote functions in a useful manner which can be applied over and over again. With this tool set, the work of a Data Scientist can be accelerated significantly.
